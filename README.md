Instructions:

- During the installation, it is important to save the path where you are installing it.
- By default, te path it is: C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe
- if you changed the installation path, copy it and go to VGC Battle Log folder: Resources/OCR_Path.txt 
- Open the file OCR_Path.txt, delete the content and paste you own path. Save changes.

Once Tesseract it ins installed. Just run VGC Battle Log and follow instructions on screen.
